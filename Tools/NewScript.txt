Amy: Where'd you go?
Sonic: Just out!
Amy: He's so mysterious!

Chris: Wow Ella, they're coming to see me!
Ella: What a nice surprise!
Chris: It's not even my birthday! Err.. uh oh...
Mr. Tanaka: Is there something wrong?
Chris: No, I'm all done! Can I go now?
Ella: Yes, go ahead!
Chris: See ya later!
Ella: Something is up!
Chris: I've gotta go to school so I'm counting on you guys to stay out of sight when my parents show up.
Nessa: Gotcha, no problem!
Amy: Yeah sure, you can count on us!
Chris: It won't be for long. Mum and Dad's visits have to be short because they both have busy schedules.

[Sonic gets up and walks off without saying anything.]

Chris: Hey, Sonic! Is he mad at me?
Amy: Don't mind him!
Chuck: Get going, Chris! You'll be late for school if you don't hurry up!
Chris: Ahh.. [Chris runs down the stairs in a hurry only to fall off.] I'm okay!

[Nessa, Amy and Chuck let out a breath of relief.]

Nessa: Chris sure is happy about his folks visiting, huh Chuck?
Chuck: He is.
Amy: What did they do?
Chuck: Chris' dad is the president of a huge software company. He spends most of his time in the office or travelling on business.
Amy: And what about his mum?
Chuck: She's a star. A famous actress who jets all around the world making movies.
Nessa: I bet it's pretty tough for Chris for not having his parents around most of the time.
Chuck: Yes.
Amy: He must miss them.
Dr. Eggman: Grr, I've got to think of something... err..AH! I've got to think of a way to conquer this planet! Perhaps the children, maybe one of my robots could brainwash the school kiddies so that they'd love me and honor me and look up to me as a hero and they could persuade their parents to accept me as their ruler!
Decoe: Here are your choices. [Passes the cards to Eggman.]
Dr. Eggman: Hmm, let's see... this is a tough one! I'll let the machine decide! [Places the cards inside the slot and pulls down the handle.] Perfect!

[A teacher-like robot emerges from the runway of the fortress and flies to Chris' school.]

Kid 1: What do you think this is?
Kid 2: I don't know...
Chris: That doesn't make any sense!
Frances: I don't even know where to start!
Kid 3: I'm totally lost!
Chris: Should we wake him up?
Danny: No, don't!
Frances: Maybe he'll put us to sleep!
Intelligente: My, my! What an intelligent-looking class! Oh, perhaps I've arrived during nap time!
Mr. Stewart: Uh, I'm sorry, what are you?
Intelligente: Hmm, I'll give you 3 guesses, young man!
Mr. Stewart: You're a robot?
Intelligente: A robot teacher! Hmm, goodbye! I'm taking over!
Mr. Stewart: You are?
Intelligente: I am!
Mr. Stewart: How's that- [Intelligente picks up Mr. Stewart and tosses him away.] They're replacing me with a robot, huh? Wait 'til I give the principal a piece of my mind!
School Principal: Delicious!
Mr. Stewart: HOW DARE YOU- oh! I'm glad to know that you never hired that robot. My students will be relieved too! [Students giggling]
Intelligente: And that's how to crack an equation! Mathematics is a breed where you keep your eye on the pie!
Chris: Now it's starting to make sense!
Frances: It's easy!
Danny: Mmmm, alright!
School Principal: That robot is a great teacher! Send him on this class and study his technique! [Chuckles as he leaves.]
Mr. Stewart: But sir...

[Students cheering]

Intelligente: Thank you, class! It's an honor to teach you!
Mr. Stewart: There's something fishy here! I better check this out with headquarters! [Mr. Stewart sneaks into the boy's bathroom.] Come in, this is "Chalkboard Charlie" calling homeroom with a cold, red priority alert.
Communicator man: Let me get this straight, you want us to send in our land, sea and air forces because a robot kicked you out of your classroom?
Mr. Stewart: Roger, I'll transmit my coordinates.
Communicator man: [Laughs] We'll control him, use this! [Thumps on the desk.]
Mr. Stewart: Seems like we're having technical difficulties! I'll have to go to the police!
Police officer: So you're assaulted by a robot who took over your class and now he's holding all your students as prisoners? Stay right there, I'll be over in a jiff to investigate.
Mr. Stewart: Where is that cop? He's late! [Police alarms] Well, finally! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Come on, officer, the kids are in danger, let's move it! Just remember, the robot's dangerous! That mechanical menace just kidnapped the kids!
Intelligente: I've always wanted to play baseball. Shall we? [Kids cheer in agreement.] Well, what are we waiting for? Play ball!
Mr. Stewart: Right there! You knock it down and I'll attempt to disable its power supply! There's no time to lose!
Intelligente: Remember to keep your wrist relaxed all through the pitch, like so! You see?
Police officer: It doesn't seem like these kids are in danger to me, in fact, it looks like they're having a great time! I wish I was out there playing!
Mr. Stewart: Stop pegging out and arrest him! [Snatches the officer's burger.]
Police officer: Oy! I'm nailing you for burger burglary! [Chases Mr. Stewart] Drop that sandwich, scumbo!
Dr. Eggman: I wonder if Intelligente has successfully brainwashed those brats into admiring me yet! I better look and see if it's going! Errgh, what's this?!
Intelligente: I'm ready!
Danny: Put it over the plate!
Frances: You can do it! Throw him a curveball! [Chris throws the ball, which Intelligente hits it high.] Mr. Intelligente is amazing!
Intelligente: My first home run! How thrilling! Baseball is such an exhilarating activity!
Decoe: Intelligente sure is a hit with his students. They love him.
Dr. Eggman: He's supposed to make those kids love me, not himself!
Mr. Tanaka and Ella: Welcome home.
Nelson and Lindsey: Thank you.
Chuck: Linsey, Nelson.
Nelson: Good to see you, dad.
Lindsey: Hello, father. How is everything going here at home?
Chuck: Wonderfully well, now that the two of you are here.
Nelson: When does Chris get back home from school?
Nessa: Chris' dad seems like a nice guy.
Amy: His mom is really pretty! Don't you think so, Sonic?
Sonic: Mmmpph...
Amy: Aw..
Kids: Yay! Go, Danny! Knock it out!
Chris: Wow, nice shot!
Frances: That is gone!

[Intelligente rockets to the air, catching the ball in mid-air.]

Chris: That's the greatest catch ever!
Frances: Woah, he's cool!
Intelligente: Oh well, well, well! Seems that the retro thruster aren't as rusty as I thought! [Chuckles] Reminds me of the early days on the cricket field from when I was no bigger than a laptop! [Chuckles.]
Bokkun: Message for you.
Intelligente: Huh? Bokkun!
Bokkun: Dr. Eggman has a message for you.
Intelligente: Hmm, a message?
Bokkun: How would you like to visit the junkyard!
Intellligente: Do you mean he's sniffed at me?
Bokkun: Sure the doc said he's angry at you that those kids are supposed to get stuck on him not you, bucket brain!
Intelligente: That used to be my mission! [Bokkun grunts angrily.] I'm afraid that's all changed!
Bokkun: Huh, how come?
Intelligente: I was sent here to make these students admire Dr. Eggman but I found it more rewarding to be admired myself!
Bokkun: What?! You blown a circuit or something?! Don't you know Dr. Eggman will turn you into scrap metal, you barrel of bolts!
Frances: Mr. Intelligente, what's going on?
Intelligente: Dr. Eggman may do with me as he wishes but I refuse to abandon the students in my charge!
Frances: You're the greatest teacher I've known! I wish all teachers were as great as you are!
Chris: Me too!
Danny: Same here!
Intelligente: Oh... thank you... that's wonderful! [Makes "crying" sounds]
Bokkun: Stop crying and teach those kids to admire Dr. Eggman! Now I'm crying!
Decoe: He lost it.
Dr. Eggman: That crybaby! They should like me!
Intelligente: I'll see you all tomorrow, class!
Chris: I've gotta hurry home now, guys!
Frances: Yeah, how come?
Chris: Because my mum and dad are coming home for a visit! See ya!
Dr. Eggman: Intelligente!
Intelligente: Oh my hard drive, it's you!
Dr. Eggman: I bet you think you're smart for disobeying my orders, you transistorized traitor, but I'll fix you!
Intelligente: No, please don't disassemble me! Chris, help me get away!
Chris: Huh, but what about what you said that a few minutes ago when you swore you'd never abandon us no matter what Dr. Eggman threatened to do to you?
Intelligente: I really said "no matter what"?
Frances: You did!
Danny: We all heard it!
Intelligente: I suppose there's no way around it! What was I thinking? [Dr. Eggman laughs]
Chris: What's so funny?
Dr. Eggman: You really don't believe that snivelling circuit box plans to keep his promise! I'm ordering him to keep you in detention where you will be forced to respect me!
Chris: No way!
Danny: What a snake!
Dr. Eggman: Listen robot, unless you want to end up in a scrap heap, you will follow my orders!
Intelligente: Yes, sir!
Chris: I'm not staying! I've gotta go home!
Intelligente: Not so fast! You'll stay in detention with the rest 'til Dr. Eggman dismisses you!
Chuck: I wonder what's keeping Chris. He knows that you two are here to see him.
Lindsey: What if there's been an accident?
Nelson: I'm sure my security people would find out and contact me.
Lindsey: You're right. He's probably playing with his friends and simply hasn't noticed the time.
Ella: I wonder what's keeping Chris. Dinner's almost ready!
Mr. Tanaka: Perhaps I should go and look for him.
Ella: You know that the Thorndykes don't want Chris babied or treated different from the other kids! I'm sure he's fine!
Nelson: I'm going to look for the boy!
Lindsey: Nelson, have some faith in your son.
Nelson: Huh, right. He's a level-headed boy and I'm sure there's a good reason why he's late. WE HAVE TO STAY CALM!
Chuck: (He hasn't changed since he was a boy.)
Amy: I'm getting worried now, too!
Nessa: Hey, Sonic!
Amy: Could you go look?

[Sonic runs off.]

Intelligente: For today's art class, we will sketch the illustrious figure of the great Dr. Eggman! As you draw, take special notes of the doctor's noble visage and dignified bearing!
Dr. Eggman: Does this pose inspire you? Or how about something more dynamic!
Chris: Uggh, it doesn't matter how that man stands, he'll always look terrible!

[Sonic runs past the students, Eggman and Intelligente causing the books to fly into the air.]

Frances: Hey, what was that?
Intelligente: What?
Dr. Eggman: Perhaps a pose as a champion!
Intelligente: You mean a chump! You're so busy showing off you haven't noticed that we're under attack!
Sonic: I'd always knew you were a poser, Eggman!
Dr. Eggman: Intelligente!
Intelligente: Yes sir!
Dr. Eggman: Get rid of Sonic!
Danny and Frances: Who's Sonic?
Intelligente: Yes sir, whatever you say!

[Intelligente fires missiles at Sonic only for the hedgehog to dodge all of them and charge right into his body, destroying Intelligente.]

Danny: Wow!
Frances: He's tough!
Dr. Eggman: Here Sonic, your prize!
Sonic: What prize?
Dr. Egmman: A little reward for your victory!
Sonic: I don't want a booby prize!
Dr. Eggman: Fine, you take it!
Chris: No thanks, keep it!
Frances: Yuck, who'd want that?!
Danny: Nasty!
Dr. Eggman: Alright, I'll wear it myself! Bye! [Jumps into the Egg Mobile and flies away.]
Frances: He's a weirdo!
Danny: Yeah!
Chris: He could keep me after school for a million years and I still wouldn't admire him!
Sonic: You'd better hurry home, Chris. Your parents are waiting.
Chris: Yeah, that's right!
Danny: He's so cool!
Frances: Sure is!
Mr. Stewart: You know, maybe there's more to being a school teacher than just passing out homework and taking naps in class.
Police officer: Enjoying my burger, bub! Hey, get back here! Stop chewing you thief! One more and I'll call out the SWAT team!
Chris: Hey mom and dad, I'm home!
Lindsey and Nelson: It's Chris!
Nelson: Son!
Lindsey: I was so worried!
Nelson: I told your mother you could look after yourself but she wouldn't listen!
Chris: Sorry, I've got held up at school!
Nelson: [Chuckles] Of course, there was absolutely nothing to be worried about! You know, when I was your age, I was kept after school a few times myself. [Chuckles]
Lindsey: Oh, I'm sure Chris is better-behaved than you, o-dear!
Chuck: That's for sure! Actually Chris, your father was more worried about your absence than he lets off! Wasn't he, Tanaka?
Mr. Tanaka: Well, Mr. Thorndyke was concerned enough to phone the President.
Ella: And Mrs. Thorndyke called all the DD Networks to get it on the bulletin on the nineteen news!
Lindsey: Ugh, I didn't call all of them!
Nessa: The Throndyke seem like a real nice family, don't they Amy?
Amy: I'm glad Chris made it back home on-time!
Nessa: Uh huh, it always feels good to be back at home!
 RALEIGH:Oh, my God. Look at her. Gipsy Danger.

 RALEIGH:God, it's so beautiful.

 RALEIGH:She looks like new.

 MAKO: Better than new.

 MAKO:She has a double-core nuclear reactor.

 MAKO:She's one of a kind now.

 MAKO:She always was.
  
 RALEIGH:Thank you for your honesty. You might be right.But one day, when you're a pilot, you're gonna see that in combat...you make decisions. And you have to live with the consequences. That's what I'm trying to do.
 
 MAKO:The candidates are ready. We will commence the trials immediately, sir.
 
 RALEIGH:Good. But there is one thing.
  
 RALEIGH:Mako, we have talked about this.
  
 MAKO:We will not be talking about it again.You promised me.
  
 Mako: Vengeance is like an open wound. You cannot take that level of emotion into the Drift.

 AI: I'm tracking it, but I'm getting no vital signs.

 MAKO: I can't find his pulse. I don't think he's breathing.
   Nessa: "The enemy has captured Captain Keyes, and are holding him aboard one of their cruisers, the Truth and Reconciliation. The ship is currently holding position approximately three hundred meters above the other end of this plateau."
 ODST: "So how do we get inside the ship if it's in the air? The Corps issued me a rifle, not wings."
 Nessa: "Once we get inside the ship, I should be able to lock on to the tracking signal from Captain Keyes' neural implants."
 ODST: "Everybody out!"
 Sergeant Parker: "Hit it Marines, go go go! The Corps ain't payin' us by the hour!"
 Nessa: "Stick to the higher ground on the right. We should be able to recon the Covenant position without being spotted. I'm detecting Covenant Stationary Guns near the next pass. I recommend using your Sniper Rifle to take out the gunners while I call for Marine support. (over radio) Get ready to move in to support us, Sergeant. The Master Chief is going to covertly take out as many of the Covenant as he can. Don't open fire until you hear the enemy return fire on us. That should let us keep the element of surprise."
 Sergeant Parker: "Let 'em have it!"
 Nessa: "Alert! A Covenant is making a run for that stationary gun. (Drops NAV point on Grunt) Take him out!"
 ODST: "Hey, we did it! We're right behind you, Chief!"
 Nessa: "Stop. Motion tracker shows movement around the next bend."
 Sergeant Parker: "We're ready to advance as soon as you call for us, Nessa."
 Nessa: "Covenant forces detected up ahead. The path up on the left should let us sneak up around them."
 Sergeant Parker: "We'll hang back while you get into position, Chief."
 Nessa: "Nessa to Fire Team Charlie. The Chief has the left flank covered. Recommend you move up the middle."
 Nessa: "Nessa to Fire Team Charlie. The Chief has secured the middle. Get ready to move up the left, you should be able to flank the enemy."
 ODST: "Roger that."
 Nessa: "Alert! Covenant Dropships are inbound!"
 Nessa: "We're directly under the ship now."
 ODST: "Alright! Are we bad or what?"
 ODST 2: "Mother of God...I'd never thought I'd get close to one of these things. How the hell are we suppose to get inside that monster?"
 ODST 2: "If we're gonna board that thing, we need a plan."
 Nessa: "The Covenant use a Gravity Lift to ferry troops and supplies between the ship and the surface. We need to ambush them at the Grav Lift's loading zone, and use the lift to enter the ship."
 ODST: "Oh, is that all! Thats's us, the few, the proud, the expendable."
 Nessa: "Nessa to Echo 419, requesting reinforcements from our position."
 Foe Hammer (COM): "Roger, Nessa, Echo 419 on approach."

 Covenant troops soon drop from the cruiser's Gravity Lift, engaging the team.

ODST: "Contact, enemy in sight!"

or

Sergeant Parker: "Covenant forces sighted! Let's hit 'em, Charlie Team!"

ODST: "Crap, those stationary guns are gonna tear us to pieces!"

or

ODST: "Sir, those freakin' guns have us pinned down!"

As another Spirit approaches:

Nessa: "Alert! Covenant Dropships are inbound!"

ODST: "Man, there's always something..."

After the team kills everything, including a pair of Hunters:

Sergeant Parker: "We've secured the area. Let's square away the grav lift. Marines! Prepare for boarding action."

or

Sergeant Parker: "This area's clear. No hostiles present. Marines, secure the grav lift and prepare for boarding!"

ODST: "Yes, sir!"

ODSTs gather under the grav lift

If any of the Marines are KIA:

Nessa (COM): "Nessa to Echo 419. We've reached the Gravity Lift and are ready for reinforcements."

Foe Hammer (COM): "Copy that, Nessa. Hang tight, gentlemen. Foe Hammer out."

Nessa: "Once we're inside the ship, I can home in on the Captain's command-neural interface. He'll probably be in or near the ship's brig, which should narrow our search."

Foe Hammer (COM): "Echo 419 inbound, clear the drop zone."

Staff Sergeant Johnson: "Go, go, go!"

or

Staff Sergeant Stacker: "Everybody out!"

Marines exiting the Pelican greet the Chief before taking position around the lift.
Into the Belly of the Beast

{Cutscene}

Marine 1: "Whoa!"

The Marine begins to float into the air.

Marine 2: "Yee-haw!"

Chief begins to float upwards.

Once the team gets inside:

{Gameplay}

Nessa: "We're in. I've got a good lock on the Captain's CNI transponder. No Covenant defenses detected."

Marine 1: "What, there's no Covenant here? Maybe nobody's home..."

The bay doors open and Covenant troops begin to attack the squad.

Marine 2: "Contacts! Lots of contacts!"

Marine 3: (sarcastically) "No Covenant! Ya had to open your mouth!"

The Chief and the Marines fight off multiple waves of Covenant reinforcements attacking from all sides. After the last wave has been defeated, a pair of massive blast doors open to reveal a Hunter pair.

Once the Hunters are killed:

Marine 2: "Area secure, Sir. We'd better keep moving. How about that door?"

The team exits the cargo bay through the open doors the Hunters came through. They head down the corridor but are stopped by a second set of blast doors:

Marine 2: "The door's locked, sir. I can't bypass it. We can't get through here."

or

Marine 3: "The door's locked, sir. No way through."

Nessa (COM): "We can use the side passages to find a way around."

Sergeant Parker: "We'd be sitting ducks in that narrow space. We can hold this position if you can find your way around and open the door from the other side, Chief."

Nessa: "Chief, let's see if we can find a way to open this door."

As the Chief goes alone and makes his way to a balcony overlooking another cargo bay:

Nessa: "Wait. That's the locked door down there. The Marines are waiting on the other side. The controls to open it must be somewhere in this room."

The Chief makes it to the ground level and opens the door, letting the rest of the team inside.

After the cargo bay has been secured:

Marine 3: "All clear, sir!"

Nessa: "We should get moving."

Marine 1: "Alright, everybody stay cool. Yell if you see anything."

The team soon enters a large docking bay just in time to witness a Covenant dropship taking off.

If three or more Marines are dead:

Nessa: "Nessa to Echo 419, requesting reinforcements at our position."

Foe Hammer (COM): "Foe Hammer here, Nessa... I read you, but you're inside the Covenant ship. I'm not sure I can — "

Nessa (COM): "Lock onto my signal and approach fast and low. There's a shuttle bay on the ship's starboard side."

Foe Hammer (COM): "Roger, Nessa - Echo 419 on approach."

The Chief and the rest of the team go around the docking bay battling multiple waves of Covenant.

When the team reaches the door on the other side:

Marine 3: "Hey, which way should we go now? All the doors on this level are locked!"

Nessa (COM): "Wait a moment. I'm going to access the Covenant Battlenet and locate an override code to open a door."

Marine 2: "You'd better hurry Nessa, we can't hold them off all day."

Nessa (COM): "Working on it." (To the Master Chief) "I'd like to see you crack a 128,000-bit modulating encryption key."

Once you kill the pair of Hunters:

Nessa: "Got it. The door is open. Everyone should move through now. I can't guarantee that it won't lock again when it closes."

The Chief leads the team up to the second level.

If every Marine in the team is dead, as the Chief approaches the second level of the docking bay:

Nessa: "I'm going to call for reinforcements. There's no sense going in with anything less than full strength."

Nessa (COM): "Nessa to Foe Hammer. We need additional support troops. We're going to open the shuttle bay door again. Move in and drop off reserve troops on my signal."

Foe Hammer (COM): "I copy, Nessa. Echo 419 standing by for your signal."

As the Chief disengages the energy shield over the bay doors:

Nessa (COM): "Nessa to Echo 419. The shuttle bay door is open. You can start your approach."

Foe Hammer (COM): "Roger. Echo 419 inbound."

The Chief leads the Marines up to the third level.

Once the team reaches the ship's bridge and kills all the Covenant forces inside including the Zealot Shipmaster:

Nessa: "This looks like the ship's command center. The Captain's transponder signal is strong, he must be close."

Marine 1: "This is a good spot, Chief. We'll mind the store here while you go find the Captain. Good luck, sir."

or

Sergeant Parker: "This looks like a good spot. We'll mind the store here while you go after the Captain. Good luck."

The Chief heads off to rescue the Captain.

When the Chief come across an empty brig:

Nessa : "We must be in the brig. These look like holding cells. There are probably multiple detention stations. The Captain must be in one of them. We need to keep looking for him."

When the Chief comes across an occupied detention center:

Marine POW 1: "It's the Chief!"

Marine POW 2: "Chief! Chief! Let me out, man!"

Captain Keyes: "Watch out Chief, the Covenant guards are using some sort of stealth armor."

When the Chief kills all the Covenant guards including two Stealth Elites and another Zealot:

Captain Keyes: "Good work, Chief."

Marine Corporal (POW): "That was amazing, sir, you really kicked the shi—"

Captain Keyes: "Stow it, Corporal! Chief, open these cells, and let's get the hell out of here. The power control's along the back wall."

The Chief opens all the cells.

{Cutscene}

The Chief helps Keyes to his feet

Captain Keyes: "Coming here was reckless. You two know better than this....thanks."

Keyes and the Chief leave the cell. Keyes addresses the freed Marines.

Captain Keyes: "Marines! Lock and load your weapons, let's be ready to move."

Marine 1: "Okay, Sir."

Marine 2: "Yes, Sir."

The three freed Marines, each armed with a Plasma Rifle, assemble in front of the Captain.

Captain Keyes: "While the Covenant had us locked up in here, I overheard the guards talking about this ring world. They call it... "Halo"."

Nessa (COM): "One moment, sir. Accessing the Covenant Battlenet. (Pause) According to the data in their networks, the ring has some kind of deep religious significance. If I'm analyzing this correctly, they believe that Halo is some kind of weapon. One with vast, unimaginable power."

Captain Keyes: "And it's true... The Covenant kept saying that whoever controls Halo controls the fate of the universe."

Nessa (COM): "Now I see... I have intercepted a number of messages about a Covenant search team, scouting for a "control room". I thought they were looking for the bridge of a cruiser that I damaged during the battle above the ring. But they must be looking for Halo's control room."

Captain Keyes: "That's bad news. If Halo is a weapon, and the Covenant gain control of it, they'll use it against us and wipe out the entire human race." (Pause) "Chief, Nessa. I have a new mission for you. We need to beat the Covenant to Halo's control room. Marines! Let's move!"

Marine 1: "Yes, Sir."

Marine 2: "Okay, Sir."

The Captain picks up a fallen Needler.

Captain Keyes: "Chief, you have the point."

Shut Up and Get Behind me... Sir

{Gameplay}

Nessa: "We should head back to the shuttle bay and call for evac."

A pair of Stealth Elites armed with Plasma Rifles charge into the brig and the fighting resumes.

If Captain Keyes dies at some point:

Nessa: "No! Without the Captain... (sad and slow) the Covenant have already won..."

or

Nessa: "No! We lost the Captain..."

The game then reverts to the last checkpoint.

After fighting their way back to the bridge, the Chief and the others discover that Sergeant Parker and his squad have been killed by two Stealth Elites with Energy Swords.

After the Stealth Elites have been killed:

Nessa: "We made it!

Nessa (COM): Nessa to Echo 419 - We have the Captain and need extraction on the double."

Foe Hammer (COM): "Negative, Nessa. I've been engaged by Covenant air patrols, and I'm havin' a tough time shakin' 'em. You'll be better off findin' your own ride... sorry."

Nessa (COM): "Acknowledged, Foe Hammer. Nessa out.
Nessa: Air support is cut off, Captain. We need to hold here until she can move in."
Marine POW 1: "Aw, man! We're trapped in here! We're screwed! We're screwed, man!"
Marine POW 2: "Oh great! Now we're trapped here. We're screwed!"
Captain Keyes "Stow the bellyaching, soldier. Remember you're a leatherneck. Nessa, if you and the Chief can get us into one of those Covenant dropships I can fly us outta here."
Nessa (COM): "Yes, Captain. There's a Covenant dropship still docked."
Nessa: "That's it. The dropship is loose."
Captain Keyes: "Everybody, mount up. Let's get onboard."
Nessa (COM): "Give me a minute to interface with the ship's controls."
Captain Keyes: "No, no need. I'll take this bird out myself."
Nessa (COM): Captain! Hunters!"
Captain Keyes: "Hang on!"
Captain Keyes: "Time for a little payback."
Chief Tui: Thank you, Mother, that's enough.
Nessa: Papa!
Chief Tui: No one goes outside the reef. We're safe here. There is no darkness. There are no monsters.
(Children screaming)
Chief Tui: There is nothing beyond that reef but storm and rough sea. As long as we stay on our very safe island, we'll be fine.
Gramma Tala: The legends are true. Someone will have to go.
Chief Tui: Mother, Motunui is paradise. Who would want to go anywhere else?
Chief Tui: Nessa! Oh, there you are. Nessa, what are you doing? You scared me.
Nessa: Fun, I wants go back.
Chief Tui: I know, I know, but you don't go out there. It's dangerous. Nessa, come on... Let's go back to the village. You are the next great chief of our people.
Sina: And you'll do wondrous things, my little minnow.
Chief Tui: Oh yes, but first, you must learn where you're meant to be.
Chief Tui:   Nessa, make way, make way / Nessa, it's time you knew / The village of Motunui is all you need / The dancers are practicing / They dance to an ancient song / (Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need) / This tradition is our mission / And Nessa, there's so much to do (Make way) / Don't trip on the taro root, that's all you need / We share everything we make (We make) / We joke and we weave our baskets (Aha!) / The fishermen come back from the sea  
Nessa:   I wanna see  
Chief Tui:   Don't walk away / Nessa, stay on the ground now / Our people will need a chief and there you are  
Chief Tui and Sina:   There comes a day / When you're gonna look around / And realize happiness is where you are  
Chief Tui:   Consider the coconut (the what?) / Consider its tree / We use each part of the coconut, that's all we need  
Sina:   We make our nets from the fibers / The water's sweet inside / We use the leaves to build fires / We cook up the meat inside  
Chief Tui:   Consider the coconuts / The trunks and the leaves / The island gives us what we need  
Nessa:   And no one leaves  
Chief Tui:   That's right, we stay /We're safe and we're well provided / And when we look to the future / There you are / You'll be okay / In time you'll learn just as I did  
Chief Tui and Sina:   You must find happiness right where you are  
Gramma Tala:   I like to dance with the water / The undertow and the waves / The water is mischievous, ha! / I like how it misbehaves / The village may think I'm crazy / Or say that I drift too far / But once you know what you like, well, there you are /
You are your father's daughter / Stubbornness and pride / Mind what he says but remember / You may hear a voice inside / And if the voice starts to whisper / To follow the farthest star / Nessa, that voice inside is who you are  
Nessa: Dad! I was only looking at the boats. I wasn't gonna get on them.
Chief Tui: Come on. There's something I need to show you. I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes. This is a sacred place. The place of chiefs. There will come a time when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain. Like I did. Like my father did. And his father and every chief there has ever been. And on that day, when you place your stone, you will raise this whole island higher. You are the future of our people, Nessa. They are not out there. They are right here. It's time to be who they need you to be.
Villagers:   We make our nets from the fibers (We weave our nets from the fibers) / The water's sweet inside (And we'll taste the sweet inside) / We use the leaves to build fires (We sing these songs in our choir) / We cook up the meat inside (beat inside)  
Chief Tui:   The village believes in us (Ha! That's right!) / The village believes (Ha!) / The island gives us what we need / And no one leaves  
Nessa:   So here I'll stay / My home, my people beside me / And when I think of tomorrow
Villagers:   There we are  
Nessa:   I'll lead the way / I'll have my people to guide me / We'll build our future together  
Villagers:   Where we are  
Nessa:   'Cause every path leads you back to  
Villagers:   Where you are  
Nessa:   You can find happiness right  
Villagers:   Where you are / Where you are  
Villager: Every storm, this roof leaks no matter how many fronds I add.
Nessa:Fixed! Not the fronds... Wind shifted the post. Mmm... That's good pork. Oh, I mean... No, I wasn't... What? They're calling me, so I gotta... Bye!
Nessa: You're doing great.
Villager: Is he done yet?
Nessa: So close.
Villager: I'm curious about that chicken eating the rock. He seems to lack the basic intelligence required for pretty much... everything. Should we maybe just... cook him?
Nessa: Sometimes our strength lies beneath the surface. Far beneath... in... some cases. But I'm sure there's more to Heihei than meets the eye.
Villager: It's the harvest. This morning I was husking the coconuts and...
Nessa: Well... We should clear the diseased trees. And we will start a new grove... there.
Villager: Thanks, Nessa. She's doing great.
Chief Tui: This suits you.
Villager: Chief! There's something you need to see. Our traps in the east lagoon. They're pulling up less and less fish.
Nessa: Then we'll rotate the fishing ground.
Villager: We have, there's no fish.
Nessa: Oh... Then we'll fish far side of the island.
Villager: We tried.
Nessa: The windward side?
Villager: And the leeward side. The shallows, the channel. We tried the whole lagoon. They're just... gone.
Villagers:
-What have you tried using for the bait?
-I don't use it as a bait.
Chief Tui: I will talk to the council. I'm sure we'll...
Nessa: What if... we fished beyond the reef?
Chief Tui: No one goes beyond the reef.
Nessa: I know. But if there are no fish in the lagoon...
Chief Tui: Nessa...
Nessa: And there's a whole ocean...
Chief Tui: We have one rule.
Nessa: An old rule, when there were fish.
Chief Tui: A rule that keeps us safe!
Nessa: But Dad!
Chief Tui: Instead of endangering our people so you can run right back to the water! Every time I think you're past this. No one goes beyond the reef!
Sina: Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad... standing on a boat.
Nessa: I didn't say "go beyond the reef" because I want to be on the ocean.
Sina: But you still do. He's hard on you, because...
Nessa: Because he doesn't get me.
Sina: Because he was you. Drawn to the ocean. Down by the shore. He took a canoe, Nessa. He crossed the reef and found an unforgiving sea. Waves like mountains. His best friend begged to be on that boat. He couldn't save him. He's hoping he can save you. Sometimes, who we wish we were, what we wish we can do is just not meant to be.
Nessa:   I've been staring at the edge of the water / Long as I can remember, never really knowing why / I wish I could be the perfect daughter / But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try / Every turn I take, every trail I track / Every path I make, every road leads back / To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be / See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me / And no one knows, how far it goes / If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me / One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go / I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island / Everything is by design / I know everybody on this island has a role on this island / So maybe I can roll with mine / I can lead with pride, I can make us strong / I'll be satisfied if I play along / But the voice inside sings a different song / What is wrong with me? / See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding / But no one knows, how deep it goes / And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me / And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line? / See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me / And no one knows, how far it goes / If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me / One day I'll know, how far I'll go  
Nessa: I can do this. There's more fish beyond the reef. There's more beyond the reef. Not so bad. Pua!
(Gasping for air)
Gramma Tala: Whatever just happened, blame it on the pig.
Nessa: Grandma... Are you gonna tell dad?
Gramma Tala: I'm his mom. I don't have to tell him anything.
Nessa: He was right. About going out there. It's time to put my stone on the mountain.
Gramma Tala: Okay. Well, then head on back. Put that stone up there.
Nessa: Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?
Gramma Tala: You said that's what you wanted.
Nessa: It is.
Gramma Tala: When I die, I'm going to come back as one of these. Or I chose the wrong tattoo.
Nessa: Why are you acting weird?
Gramma Tala: I'm the village crazy lady. That's my job.
Nessa: If there's something you want to tell me, just tell me. Is there something you want to tell me?
Gramma Tala: Is there something you want to hear? You've been told all our people's stories but one.
Nessa: What is this place?
Gramma Tala: Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?
Nessa: What's in there?
Gramma Tala: The answer to the question you keep asking yourself. Who are you meant to be? Go inside, bang the drum, and find out.
Nessa: Bang the drum.
Matai:   Tatou o tagata folau vala'auina / Le atua o le sami tele e o mai / O ava'e le lu'itau e lelei / Tapenapena  
Voyagers:   Aue, aue / Nuku i mua / Te manulele e tataki e / Aue, aue / Te fenua te malie / Nae ko hakilia kaiga e / We read the wind and the sky when the sun is high / We sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze / At night, we name every star / We know where we are / We know who we are, who we are / Aue, aue / We set a course to find / A brand new island everywhere we roam / Aue, aue / We keep our island in our mind / And when it's time to find home / We know the way / Aue, aue, / We are explorers reading every sign / We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chain / Aue, aue, / Te fenua, te malie / Nae ko hakilia / We know the way
Nessa: We were voyagers. We were voyagers! We were voyagers! We were voyagers! We were voyagers! Why'd we stop?
Gramma Tala: Maui. When he stole from the Mother Island, darkness fell. Te Ka awoke. Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back. To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging. And now we have forgotten who we are. And the darkness has continue to spread, chasing away our fish, draining the life from island after island.
Nessa: Our island?
Gramma Tala: But one day, someone will journey beyond our reef, find Maui, deliver him across the great ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti. I was there that day. The ocean chose you.
Nessa: I thought it was a dream.
Gramma Tala: Nope! Our ancestors believed Maui lies there at the bottom of his hook. Follow it and you will find him.
Nessa: But... Why'd it choose me? I don't even know how to make it past the reef. But I know who does.
Villagers:
-The coconuts are turning black.
-What about the fish?
-It happens all over the island.
Chief Tui: Please, please. Settle down.
Villagers:
-What are you going to do?
-Who will dig new fields?
Chief Tui: We'll find a way... We...
Nessa: ... Can stop the darkness. Save our island. This cave has boats. Huge canoes. We can take them to find Maui. Make him restore the heart. We were voyagers. We can voyage again. You told me to help our people. This is how we can help our people. Dad. What are you doing?
Chief Tui: I should've burned those boats a long time ago.
Nessa: No! Don't! We have to find Maui. We have to restore the heart.
Chief Tui: There is no heart. This...this is just a rock.
Nessa: No!
Villager: Chief! It's your mother!
Chief Tui: Mother.
Villagers:
-What can be done?
Gramma Tala: Go.
Nessa: Gramma.
Gramma Tala: Go.
Nessa: Not now. I can't.
Gramma Tala: You must. The ocean chose you. Follow the fish hook.
Nessa: Grandma.
Gramma Tala: And when you find Maui, you grab him by the ear. You say... I am Nessa of Motunui. You will board my boat, sail across the sea, and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
Nessa: I... I can't leave you.
Gramma Tala: There is nowhere you could go that I won't be with you. Go.
Nessa:   There's a line where the sky meets the sea and it calls me / But no one knows how far it goes / All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me / I'm on my own, to worlds unknown / Every turn I take, every trail I track / Is a choice I make, now I can't turn back / From the great unknown, where I go alone, where I long to be / See her light up the night in the sea, she calls me / And yes, I know, that I can go / There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me / Soon I'll know, how far I'll go  
Nessa: I am Nessa of Motunui. You will board my boat, sail across the sea, and restore the heart of Te Fiti. I am Nessa of Motu... nui. Hei-hei?! It's okay. You're alright. Yes... see. There we go. Nice water. The ocean is a friend of mine. Hei-hei. Hei-hei! Stay. Ok. Next stop, Maui. I am Nessa of Motunui. You will board my boat, sail across the sea and restore the heart of Te Fiti. I am Nessa... of... Mo... tu... Board my boat! Oh, no. No ... no... no...no. No. Uh, ocean. can I get a little help? No... no. Please. Come on. Help me. Please.
Nessa: Ehmm... What? I said help me. And wrecking my boat?! Not helping! Fish pee in you... all day. So...Maui? Maui. Maui, demigod of the wind and sea, I am Nessa of Motunui. You will board my boat. No. You will board my boat. Yeah. I am Nessa of Motunui. You will board my...
Maui: Boat! A boat! The Gods have given me a (screams)
Nessa: Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea. I am Nessa...
Maui: Hero of Man.
Nessa: Wh..What?
Maui: It's actually Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea, hero of man. I interrupted, from the top, hero of man. Go.
Nessa: I am Mo...
Maui: Sorry, Sorry, sorry, sorry. And women. Men and women. Both. All. Not a guy-girl thing. Ah, you know, Maui is a hero to all. You're doing great.
Nessa: What? No, I came here to...
Maui: Oh, of course, of course. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Maui always has time for his fans. When you use a bird to write with, it's called tweeting. (laughs) I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.
Nessa: You are not my hero. And I'm not here so you can sign my oar. I'm here because you stole the heart of Te Fiti and you will board my boat, sail across the sea, and put it back.
Maui: Yeah... It almost sounds like you don't like me, which is impossible because I got stuck here for a thousand years, trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals so you could have the power to create life itself. Yeah. So what I believe you were trying to say is thank you.
Nessa: Thank you?
Maui: You're welcome.
Nessa: Wait, no, no, no. I-I didn't... I wasn't... why would I ever say...
Maui:   Okay, okay / I see what's happening here / You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange / You don't even know how you feel, It's adorable! / Well it's nice to see that humans never change / Open your eyes, let's begin / Yes it's really me, It's Maui! Breathe it in / I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod! / When you're staring at a demigod / What can I say except "You're welcome" / For the tides, the sun, the sky / Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome / I'm just an ordinary demi-guy! / Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky / while you were waddling yay high? / This guy! / When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below? / You're looking at him, yo! / Oh, also I lassoed the sun / You're welcome / To stretch your days and bring you fun / Also, I harnessed the breeze / You're welcome / To fill your sails and shake your trees / So what can I say except you're welcome? / For the islands I pulled from the sea / There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome / I guess it's just my way of being me / You're welcome, you're welcome / Well, come to think of it / Kid, honestly I can go on and on / I can explain every natural phenomenon / The tide, the grass, the ground / Oh, that was Maui just messing around / I killed an eel, I buried its guts / Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts / What's the lesson? What is the takeaway? / Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway / And the tapestry here on my skin / Is a map of the victories I win / Look where I've been, I make everything happen / Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tappin' / Well anyway, let me say you're welcome! / For the wonderful world you know / Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome! / Well, come to think of it, I gotta go / Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome! / 'Cause I'm gonna need that boat / I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome! / 'Cause Maui can do anything but float / You're welcome, you're welcome   And thank you!
Nessa: Hey, let me out! You lying slimy son of a...
Maui: Mm... Mmm. You're welcome. No... I'm not going to Te Fiti with some kid. I'm going to get my hook. You have yours, and I'm not Maui without mine. Okay, talk to the back. Boat snack. Oh, no, no, no. Don't look at me like that. It's a beautiful cave, she's gonna love it. And I'm going to love you. In my belly. Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick. I can watch that all day. Okay, enjoy the island. Maui... Out!
Nessa: No. Stop ! Hey, you have to put back the heart!
Maui: Did... not see that coming.
Nessa: I am Nessa of Motunui. This is my canoe. And you will journey to aahh...
Maui: Alright, get over it. We gotta move. And she's back.
Nessa: I am Nessa of Motun..uiiii....
Maui: It was Nessa, right?
Nessa: Yes. And you will restore the heart--
Maui: Alright, I'm out. Ahh, come on!
Nessa: What is your problem? Are you afraid of it ?
Maui: No. No, Ha..ha..ha. I'm not afraid. Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit. You stop it. That is not a heart. It is a curse. The second I took it, I got blasted out of the sky. And I lost my hook. Get it away from me.
Nessa: Get this away?
Maui: Hah .. hey .. hey... I'm a Demigod, okay? Stop that, I will smite you. You wanna get... smote? Smoten? Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life. It's a homing beacon of death. If you don't put it away, bad things will come for it.
Nessa: Come for this? The heart? You mean this heart right here... Come and get it!
Maui: You are gonna get us killed!
Nessa: No, I am gonna get us to Te Fiti. So you can put it back. Thank you. "You're welcome!"
Maui: Kakamora...
Nessa: Kaka... what?
Maui: Murdering little pirates. Wonder what they're here for?
Nessa: They're... kind of cute. Ocean, do something, help us!
Maui: The ocean doesn't help you. You help yourself. Tighten the halyard, bind the stays! ...you can't sail?!
Nessa: I... I am self-taught? Can't you shapeshift or something?
Maui: You see my hook? No magic hook. No magic powers.
Nessa: Their boat... is turning into more boats! Yup. I just did that. No, no, no, no. Hei-hei. Maui. They took the heart.
Maui: That's a chicken.
Nessa: The heart is in the... We have to get it back. Maui! There. Right there! You're turning? What are you doing?
Maui: Uh, escaping?
Nessa: The heart!
Maui: Forget it, you'll never get it back. Besides, you got a better one. Hey... What am I gonna steer with? They're just gonna kill ya!
Nessa: Coconuts. Hah... Got it. Oo... Oohh... Hey. Yeah... We did it!
Maui: Congratulations on not being dead, curly. You surprised me. But I'm still not taking that thing back. You wanna get to Te Fiti, you have to go through a whole ocean of bad. Not to mention Te Ka. Lava monster? Ever defeat a lava monster?
Nessa: No. Have you?
Maui: I'm not going on a suicide mission with some... mortal. You can't restore the heart without me. And me says no. I'm getting my hook. End of discussion.
Nessa: You'll be a hero. That's what you're about, right?
Maui: Little girl... I am a hero.
Nessa: Maybe you were, but now... Now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti. The guy who cursed the world. You're no one's hero.
Maui: Pfft... No one.
Nessa: But, put this back. Save the world. You'd be everyone's hero. Maui... Maui... Maui... You're so amaziiiiing!
Maui: Ah, we'd never make it without my hook. Not past Te Ka.
Nessa: Then we get your hook. We get your hook, take out Te Ka. Restore the heart. Unless you don't wanna be... "Maui, Demigod of the Wind and Sea, Hero to... all."
Maui: First, we get my hook.
Nessa: Then save the world. Deal?
Maui: Deal. Worth a shot. Okay, we go east to the Lair of Tamatoa. If anyone has my hook, it's that beady-eyed bottomfeeder.
Nessa: Teach me to sail. My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean. I should... I should be sailing.
Maui: It's called wayfinding, Princess. It's not just sails and knots. It's seeing where you're going in your mind... Knowing where you are... by knowing where you've been.
Nessa: Okay, first... I'm not a princess. I'm the daughter of the chief.
Maui: Same difference.
Nessa: No.
Maui: If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick... you're a princess. You're not a wayfinder. You'll never be a wayfinder. You will never be a wayf-- Really? Blowdart in my buttcheek. You are a bad person.
Nessa: If you can talk, you can teach. Wayfinding. Lesson one... hit it.
Maui: Pull the sheets. Not the sheets. No. No. No. No. Tried that one already. You're measuring the stars, not giving the sky a high-five. If the current's warm, you're going the right way.
Nessa: It's cold. Wait, it's getting warmer. Augh, that's disgusting! What's wrong with you? Black cloud... We're here. See, I told you I could do it. Motunui...? I'm... home?
Chief Tui: Nessa...
Nessa: Dad...?
Sina: Nessa...
Nessa: Mom...?
Chief Tui: Help!
Nessa: No!
Chief Tui: Nessa!
Maui: Enjoy your beauty rest? You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps. So they actually get where they need to go. Muscle up, butter cup. We're here.
Nessa: You sure this guy's gonna have your hook.
Maui: Tamatoa... oh he'll have it. He's a scavenger. Collects stuff, things that looks cool. And for Tamatoa, trust me, my hook is the coolest collectible.
Nessa: And he lives up there?
Maui: Oh, ho, no, no, no... That's just the entrance... to Lalotai.
Nessa: Lalotai ? Realm of Monsters. We're going to the Realm of Monsters.
Maui: We? No. Me. You are gonna stay here with the other chicken. That's what I'm talking about, give me some... Come on, that was a good one, how'd you not get it? I called her chicken, there's a chicken on the boat. I know she's human, but that's not... You know... forget it. Forget it, I'm not explaining it to you. What? 'Cause then it's not funny. So... Daughter of the chief. I thought you stayed in the village. You know, kissing babies and things. Hey, I'm just trying to understand why your people decided to send, uh... How do I phrase this... You.
Nessa: My people... didn't send me. The ocean did.
Maui: The ocean... Makes sense, you're what, eight? Can't sail? Obvious choice.
Nessa: It chose me... for a reason.
Maui: If the ocean's so smart, why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself? Or bring me my hook. The ocean straight up pooky dooks. But I'm sure it's not wrong about you. You're the chosen one.
Nessa: The ocean chose you for a reason.
Maui: If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.
Nessa: So... not seeing an entrance.
Maui: Yes, because it only appears after a human sacrifice. Kidding! Ha, ha, ha... So serious. Don't worry, it's a lot farther down than it looks. Chee-hoo! I am still falling!
Nessa: You can do this... Go.
Maui: And he sticks the landing! What? Dumb-dumb, she's not even here. No mortal's gonna jump into the realm of mon... Well... She's dead. Okay, let's get my hook.
Nessa: Maui's fishhook.
Maui: Yeah....
Nessa: Sorry. I thought you were a monster, but... I found your hook and you're right... This Tamatoa really likes treasure.
Maui: Stay.
Nessa: What? No! I'm... I'm the one who...
Maui: Listen. For a thousand years, I've only been thinking about keeping this hair silky, getting my hook, and being awesome again. And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal. Who has no business inside of a monster cave except... Except...Maybe as bait.
Nessa: *sigh* Wow, the shiny glittering cave. And just like me, it's covered in sparkling treasure. Sparkle ... Sparkle. Sparkle.
Maui: You're not selling it.
Nessa:This is stupid, I'm just gonna walk up there.
Maui: *whisper* You go out there, he will kill you. Just stick to the plan. Oh! When he shows up, keep him distracted. Make him talk about himself. He loves bragging about how awesome he is.
Nessa: Well, you two must get along perfectly.
Maui:Well not since I ripped his leg off.
Nessa: Wait, you did what!?
Tamatoa: Huhuhuhuuu...What have we here? It's a sparkly, shiny -wait a minute...It's a human! What are you doing down here in the realms of the monst- Just pick an eye, babe. I can't- I can't concentrate on what I saying if you keep -Yep, pick one! pick one! You're a funny looking little thing, aren't you? Oooh what's this?
Nessa: Don't, it's my grandma's!
Tamatoa *mockingly* It's my grandma's. I ate my grandma!!! And it took a week because she was absolutely humongous. Why are you here?
Nessa: Cause you're amazing! And we mortals have heard...the tales about the crab....who became a legend. And I got to know. How did you get so crab...ulous?
Tamatoa: Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself? Because if you are ...I will gladly do so!! In song form!   Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam/I was a drab little crab once../Now I know, I can be happy as a clam/Because I'm beautiful, baby./Did your granny say "listen to your heart"/Be who you are on the inside/I need three words to tear her argument apart/Your granny lied/I'd rather be shiny like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck/Scrub the deck and make it look shiny/I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck/Just a sec, don't you know?/Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb/They chase anything that glitters/Beginners/Oh, and here they come, come, come/To the brightest thing that glitters/Mmm, fish dinners/I just love free food/You look like seafood  
Nessa: No !
Maui:Hey! Crab cakes. I'm back. It's Maui time.
Tamatoa: *gasp*
Maui: What do you say, little buddy. Giant hawk? Coming up...Cheehoo!!! Cheehooooo....?
Tamatoa:  Well, well, well... Little Maui's having trouble with his look/You little semi-demi-mini-god/Ouch! What a terrible performance/Get the hook ! ( Get it ? )/You don't swing it like you used to, man/Yet I have to give you credit for my start/And your tattoos on the outside/For just like you, I made myself a work of art/I never hide, I can't/I'm too shiny/Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough/Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny/Send your armies but they'll never be enough/My shell's too tough, Maui man/You could try, try, try.../But you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod/Look it up/You will die, die, die/Now it's time for me to take apart/Your aching heart/Far from the worms who abandoned you/Chasing the love of these humans/Who made you feel wanted/You try to be tough/But your armor's just not hard enough/Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney/Ever seen someone so shiny?/Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see/C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny/Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea/Just for me/You'll never be quite as shiny/You wish you were nice and shiny  
Nessa: Hey! I got something shiny for ya.
Tamatoa: The heart of Te Fiti. You can't run from me! Oh, you can...You keep surprising me. There's only so far you can get on those two little legs. Hahahaaa. The power of creation...for the crustacean. Where is it? Where is it?
Nessa: We gotta go.
Maui: Wait, what about the heart?
Nessa:He can have it! I've got a better one.
Tamatoa: Hahahahaaa Yes! I have the ... Wait a minute... Ugh!! I see, she's taken a barnacle and she's covered it in bioluminescent algae...as a diversion. Grrr!!! Come back here!!! Raaaaahh!!! Oof!! Ugh!! Huh?
Nessa: Yahooooo!!!
Tamatoa: Hey! Hey!!...Did you like the song?
Nessa: We're alive! We're ali-- ahh!
Maui: Listen. I appreciate what you did down there.
Nessa: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmhmm.
Maui: Took guts. But... I'm sorry. I'm tryin' to be sincere for once, and it feels like you're distracted.
Nessa: No! No, no way.
Maui: Really. 'Cause you're looking at me like I have a ... shark head.
Nessa: Whaaaaat? Do you have a shark head, cause I...
Maui: Look. The point is... For a little girl... child... thing... whatever... who had no business being down there... You did me a solid. But you also almost died. And I couldn't even beat the dumb crab. So chances of beating Te Ka: bupkis. We're never making it to Te Fiti. This mission is cursed.
Nessa: It's not cursed.
Maui: Shark head.
Nessa: It's not... cursed.
Maui: Cursed. What can I say, except we're dead soon... We're dead soon...
Nessa: Can't you at least try?
Maui: ...Giant. Hawk. Hey! It's okay... it's okay... We're dead soon...
Nessa: Alright, break time is over. Get up.
Maui: Why? You gonna give me a speech? Tell me I could beat Te Ka cause I'm ..."Maui". Take a hike, tiny.
Nessa: How do you get your tattoos?
Maui: They show up when I earn them.
Nessa: How did you earn that one? What's that for?
Maui: That's, uh, man's discovery of Nunya.
Nessa: What's Nunya?
Maui: Nunya business.
Nessa: I'll just keep asking. What's it for?
Maui: You need to stop doing that. Back off.
Nessa: Just tell me what it is!
Maui: I said back off.
Nessa: Is that why your hook's not working? You don't wanna talk? Don't talk. You wanna throw me off the boat? Throw me off. You wanna tell me I don't know what I'm doing? I know I don't. I have no idea why the ocean chose me. You're right. But... my island is dying. So I am here. It's just me and you. And I want to help. But I can't if you don't let me.
Maui: I wasn't born a demigod. I had human parents. They... They took one look and decided they... did not want me. They threw me into the sea... like I was nothing. Somehow I was found by the gods. They gave me the hook. They made me... Maui. And back to the humans I went. I gave them islands, fire, coconuts. Anything they could ever want.
Nessa: You took the heart for them. You did... everything for them. So they would love you.
Maui: It was... never enough.
Nessa: Maybe the gods found you for a reason. Maybe the ocean brought you to them because it saw someone who was worthy of being saved. But the gods aren't the ones who made you Maui. You are.
Maui: Okay, okay. I... I love you too, buddy. Yeah! Next stop, Te Fiti.
Nessa: What?
Maui: I figured it out. You know the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands. 'Cause your ancestors would sail the seas and find them. All those new islands, new villages... It was the water that connected them all. And if I were the ocean, I think I'd be looking for, a... curly haired... non-princess... to start that again.
Nessa: That is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Probably should've saved that for Te Fiti.
Maui: I did. Nessa of Motunui. I believe you have officially delivered Maui across the great sea. Nessa, Nessa, Nessa... You're so amaziiiiing!
Nessa: It's time. Go, save the world. Maui...
Maui: What... What are you doing ?
Nessa: Finding you a better way in!
Maui: We won't make it!
Nessa: Yes, we will!
Maui: Turn around!
Nessa: No!
Maui: Nessa, stop!
Nessa: No! Are you okay? Maui?
Maui: I told you to turn back.
Nessa: I thought we could make it.
Maui: We?
Nessa: I thought... I could make it. We can fix it.
Maui: It was made by the gods. You can't FIX it.
Nessa: Next time we'll be more careful. Te Ka was stuck on the barrier island. It's lava. It can't go in the water. We can find a way around.
Maui: I'm not going back.
Nessa: What... We still have to restore the heart.
Maui: My hook is cracked. One more hit and it's over.
Nessa: Maui, you have to restore the heart.
Maui: Without my hook, I am nothing.
Nessa: That's not true.
Maui: Without my hook, I am nothing!
Nessa: We are only here because you stole the heart in the first place.
Maui: No, we're here because the ocean told you you're special and you believed it.
Nessa: I am Nessa of Motunui. You will board my boat--
Maui: Goodbye, Nessa.
Nessa: --Sail across the sea--
Maui: I'm not killing myself so you can prove you're something you're not.
Nessa: I must restore the heart of Te Fiti. The ocean chose me.
Maui: It chose wrong.
Nessa: Maui! Why did you bring me here? I'm not the right person. You have to choose someone else. Choose someone else. Please.
Gramma Tala: You are a long ways past the reef.
Nessa: Grandma.
Gramma Tala: Guess I chose the right tattoo.
Nessa: Grandma! I tried, grandma. I... I couldn't do it.
Gramma Tala: It's not your fault. I never should have put so much on your shoulders. If you're ready to go home, I will be with you. Why do you hesitate?
Nessa: I don't know.
Gramma Tala:   I know a girl from an island / She stands apart from the crowd / She loves the sea and her people / She makes her whole family proud / Sometimes the world seems against you / The journey may leave a scar / But scars can heal and reveal just where you are / The people you love will change you / The things you have learned will guide you / And nothing on earth can silence / the quiet voice still inside you / And when that voice starts to whisper / Nessa, you've come so far / Nessa listen / Do you know who you are?  
Nessa:   Who am I? / I am a girl who loves my island / I'm a girl who loves the sea / It calls me... / I am the daughter of the village chief / We are descended from voyagers / Who found their way across the world / They call me ... / I've delivered us to where we are / I have journeyed farther / I am everything I've learned and more / Still it calls me / And the call isn't out there at all / It's inside me / It's like the tide always / falling and raising / I will carry you here in my heart / You remind me / That come what may / I know the way / I AM MOANA!   I am Nessa of Motunui. Aboard my boat, I will sail across the sea and restore the heart of Te Fiti. The follow us under water. We'll make it past the barrier island. We'll make it to Te Fiti. None of which you understand, because you are a chicken. No! Hei-hei. No, no, no, no, no...
 Te Fiti... Maui! You came back. But your hook. One more hit, and...
Maui: Te Ka's gotta catch me first. I've got your back, chosen one. Go, save the world.
Nessa: Maui. Thank you.
Maui: You're welcome. Hey... Te Ka! Shark head! Nessa! Get the heart to the spiral!
Nessa: Te Fiti. It's gone. TE-KA!! Let her come to me.   I have crossed the horizon / to find you / I know your name / they have stolen your heart / from inside you / But this... does not define you / This is not who you are / You know who you are... / Who you truly are   Te Fiti.
Maui: The chicken lives!
Nessa: I'm sorry about your hook.
Maui: Well... hook. No hook. I'm Maui. Te Fiti! How you've been? Look, what I did was... wrong. I have no excuse. I'm sorry.
Nessa: You know, it would be rude to reject a gift from a Goddess.
Maui: Thank you. Your kindness is deeply appreciated. Chee-hoo! Gonna miss you, drumstick.
Nessa: You can come with us, you know. My people are going to need a... master wayfinder.
Maui: They already have one.
Nessa: See you out there, Maui.
Maui: See you out there, Nessa... Chee-hoo!
Nessa: Mom... Dad...
Chief Tui: Nessa!
Nessa: I may have gone a little ways past the reef.
Chief Tui: It suits you.
Matai:   Aue, Aue... We set a course to find... A brand new island everywhere we roam. Aue, Aue... We keep our island in our mind. And when it's time find home, We know the way... We are explorers reading every sign. We tell the story... About our elders in a never ending chain. Te Fenua, te Malie. Nae ko hakilia. We know the way...  

Tamatoa: Shiny, I'm so shiny... Didn't help me though, did it? Still upside down here, just need a little push. Can we be real? If my name were Sebastian and I had a cool Jamaican accent, you'd totally help me. You would, you know you would.



Maui: You help yourself.

Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

You can't sail ?

Nessa: I, uh... I am self-taught!? 

Can't you shift shape or something!

Maui: Do you see my hook? No magic hook, no magic powers. 

Nessa:Their boat ... is turning into more boats.

Yup. I just did that.

No, no, no, no. Hei-hei!

Maui, they took the heart...

Maui: That's a chicken.

Nessa:The heart is in the... Augh! We have to get it back.

Mauiii.... There. Right there!

You're turning? What are you doing?

Maui: Uh, escaping!

Nessa:The heart--

Maui: Forget it, you're never get it back. Besides, you've got a better one. Hey...

What am I gonna steer with? They're just gonna kill you.

Nessa: Coconuts. Hah... Got it. Oo... got it! Oohh... Hey. Yeah, we did it!

Maui: Congratulations, on not besing dead, curly.
